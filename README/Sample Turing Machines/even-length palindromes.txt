'''
Use these transitions to create a TM that accepts strings from the language L:
    L = {w | w âˆˆ {0,1}* and w is an even-length palindrome}

Example strings: 101101, 011110, 11, etc.

Copy the following lines of code into the 'Main' class and then run it.

    # Specify the start and accept states:
    startState = 'A'
    acceptState = 'E'
    
    
    # Define each transition as a string, like this:
    #         t = 'stateA -> stateB X,Y,Z'
    # where stateA and stateB are states of the TM;
    # X is the symbol to be read and Y is the symbol to be written;
    # Z is either L, R or S, indicating left, right or stay.
    # See the docs from the class TMHelper for details.
